                        Javascript was created by Brendan Eich during his time with Netscape at 1995<br/>
                        originally inspired by <strong>Java</strong>, javascript dominated the market<br/>

                    <p>
                        To setup your work environment, you primarely need two things :<br/>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Code Editor</strong></li>

                        </ul>

                        The code editor is the application that you will type your code in <br/>
                        for example : <br/>
                                    <ul>

                        The Compiler is what translates your code to binaries (0 and 1) so that your computer can understand it<br/>
                        in our case, we will be using a browser's console as it is easy and fun to learn, you'll preferably need<br/>
                        some basic HTML5 Knowledge, you can find it <a target='blank' href='./HTMLCourse.html#Structure'>Here</a> so that we get started , and just like a<br/>

                        just to let you know, we're using <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and <strong>Google Chrome</strong><br/>
                        to teach you how to start working in Javascript , everything you'll write in your code is called instructions<br/>
                        <strong>instructions</strong> are orders you give to your programm, each instruction ends with a <strong>semicolon ;</strong><br/>

                    <h2 id='Variables'>Declare and use <strong>Variables</strong></h2>
                    <p>

                        A <strong>Variable </strong> is a storage location that is associated to store information, and it can<br/>
                        be identified by it's unique name <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>a variable's name cannot contain spaces, only underscores '_'</li>
                                <li>a variable's name must begin with a letter, an underscore or a dollar sign '$'</li>
                                <li>variable names can only contain underscores,dollar signs, letters and numbers</li>
                            </ul>

                            There are two ways to declare a variable :<br/>
                        <div id='White'>

                            <span id='prefix'>var</span> <span id='name'>VariableName </span> = <span id='value'>value</span><br/>
                            <span id='prefix'>let</span> <span id='name'>VariableName </span> = <span id='value'>value</span><br/>
                        </div>    
                        in order to compile your code, open your browser, press <strong>CTRL + SHIFT + I</strong>  to open the<br/>
                        developper tools then choose the console .then, you can either type the script directly in the console<br/>
                        or you can type it in the html file we've created earlier,
                        this is what you should type in your script in order to show the value of a variable in the console<br/>

                        <div id='White'>
                            var age = 15;<br/>
                            console.log(age);
                        </div>
                        wich displays 15 in the screen <br/>
                        there are multiple data types that can be stored in a variable, and that are resumed <br/>

                            luckly, you don't really have to define the type of your variable when declaring<br/>
                            it in javascript,so here's how to declare the type of each variable <br/>

                    <p>
                        So variables are cool, but you wanna make your program make decisions, it's <br/>
                        simple, you have to use either <strong>Conditions</strong> or <strong>loops</strong><br/>
                        a, both <strong>Conditions</strong> and <strong>Loops</strong> work under the same<br/>
                        principle, they execute instructions after testing whether a statment is true or false<br/>
                        the only difference, is that a <strong>Condition</strong> is only executed <mark>once</mark> while<br/>
                        a <strong>loop</strong> is executed <mark>multiple times</mark>,till there is an <strong>exist condition</strong><br/>
                        now don't worry if you don't get what i'm saying for now, we'll be talking about it in details<br/>

                    <p>
                        this is the general syntax of a <strong>simple condition</strong> in javascript :<br/>

                        One condition is cool, but what if you wanna use a condition that exeutes instructions based on multiple tests <br/>
                        note that there are two ways  to write a multiple statment condition, the first is using the if statement, the <br/>
                        second is by using switch statment this is the general syntax of what you will need to write, and it's as simple<br/>
                         as a <strong>simple condition</strong><br/>

                        both <strong> switch</strong> and <strong>if</strong> statements work under the same principle, but we will be<br/>
                        mostly using the <strong>if</strong> statement in this course , however, i'll have an explainatory video that'll <br/>
                        clarify everything after i explain how loops work<br/>
                    </p>
                    <br/>
                <h2>Loops</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Loops</strong> are decision making structures that are but, and in opposition to <strong>Conditions</strong><strong>Loops</strong>
                   , the instructions inside<br/>
                    a loop are executed repeatdly until the there's an <strong title='condition that turns either true or false to get you out of the structure'>exit condition</strong>
                    that ends the condition. there are two ways to write a <br/> loop in javascript : <br/>
                </p>
                    the <strong>While</strong> loop
                    <div id="White1">
                        while (<span id='Comment'>//Entry Condition</span>)<br/>
                        {<br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id='Comment'>//instructions that are executed while the loop is true</span><br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id='Comment'>//this wont stop till the entry condition is false</span><br/>
                        }<br/>
                    </div>
                <p>
                    note that you can manually stop the loop by adding the keyword <strong>break ;</strong> anywhere inside<br/>
                    the body of your loop to stop it, but the code after the <strong>break;</strong> won't be executed , so this<br/>
                    keyword is usually written in the end of the loop or inside a condition that cancels the entry condition<br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                    the <strong>for</strong> loop unlike the<strong>While</strong>loop is executed a specefic amount of times<br/>
                    that you can define, you need to :
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>
                                                        a variable that contains the starting value of the loop
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        setting a limit to the variable, (defining how many times <br/>
                                                        the loop will render)
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        defining the step, wich is how much the value will increase or<br/>
                                                        decrease during the loop before it reaches the limit<br/>
                                                    </li>
                                                </ul>
                    This is the genereal syntax of a <strong>For Loop</strong>While</strong>:
                </p>
                <div id='White2'>
                    for(<span id='Comment'>Declaring the starting value</span>; <span id='Comment'>Setting the end Value</span> ; <span id='Comment'>The step value</span>)<br/>

                    This list contains the <strong>operators</strong> that you will use to test your <strong>Conditions</strong> and <strong>Loops</strong><br/>

                <h2>Store data in tables</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tables</strong> in javascript,allow you to store multiple data in one variable<br/>
                    this is the general syntax of a Table <br/>
                </p>
                <div id='White2'>
                    Table = [ <span id='Comment'>'variable' , 12 , 123.32123 , true</span> ]<br/>
                    Table2= [ ];<br/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    as you may notice, a <strong>table</strong> in javascript can contain all types of data<br/>
                    (integer,double,string,bool)<br/>
                    the second line shows you how to declare an empty table<br/>
                </p>
                <h2>Modularise your code using functions</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Functions</strong> are pieces of code that'll allow you to write shorter code, so instead of writing<br/>
                    the same thing once,you can define a <strong>function</strong> and call it everytime you need it, a function<br/>
                    can have as much parameters as you want, it can also contain no parameters wich means you'll leave what's <br/>
                    between the brackets empty<br/>
                    this is the general syntax of a function
                </p>
                

                <div id='White2'>
                    function  Name(<span id='Comment'>You put the parameters here</span>)<br/>
                    {<br/>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span id='Comment'>You write the instructions to execute here</span><br/>

                    <span id='Comment'>Down here is how you call the function</span><br/>
                    Name(<span id='Comment'>Parameters</span>);<br/>

                    <span id='Comment'>//Mi Gna</span>
                </div>

                <p>Example of defining and calling a function :</p>
                <div id='White2'>
                    function Add(Param1,Param2)<br/>
                    {<br/>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return Param1+Param2;<br/>
                    }<br/>
                    console.log(Add(1,2));<br/>
                </div>
                <p>
                    As you may notice, there's a new word wich is <strong>return</strong>, return specifies the <br/>
                    value that you want your function to return, for the example i just wrote, the function returns<br/>
                    the result of an addition of the two parameters, then the function is called to be executed to<br/>
                    to show the addition of the 2 and 1 wich will display 3 in the console.<br/>
                    if the function has no parameter and you wanna add a <strong>return</strong> in your function<br/>
                    the returned value has to be created inside the function as a <strong>variable</strong>
                </p>
